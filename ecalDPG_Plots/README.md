2020-03-31 refine the plots for final approval
	- remove integrated luminosity in plots. In many plots the number is misleading because partial datasets are used. For the others, let's just comply with the same convention.
	- "Run 1" and "Run 2" need space between word and digit
	- align "CMS Preliminary" in the same way for all plots, possibly at the edge of the left border
	- In the 2016 mee plot legend, change "Preliminary" with "Initial"
	- align "CMS Preliminary" to left edge, and "Run 2 (13 TeV)" to right edge (note space between "Run" and 2)
	- it is ok to align "Run 2 (13 TeV)" at the edge of the big panel and not to the rightmost edge, as long as same convention is used for all plots
